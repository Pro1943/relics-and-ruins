🏛️ MAIN PREMISE (simple + strong)
Centuries ago, a powerful civilization fell after misusing ancient relics.
Now, the Ruin Warden — a corrupted guardian — controls the heart of the old kingdom.

You’re a scavenger trying to uncover relics, 
survive the ruins, and eventually confront the Warden before the corruption spreads.

📜 STORY PROGRESSION (ACT 1 → ACT 3)
Think of this like chapters or milestones you can easily implement in CLI.

ACT 1 — The Fallen Frontier
Goal: Learn the world + get your first relic
Gameplay Loop:
Start in a safe camp with a basic shop.

NPC explains ruins have “Prime Relics” that grant access to deeper areas.

You explore low-level ruins, fight weak enemies, gather gold, maybe find relic scraps.

First small boss → drops your First Prime Relic.

Story Beat:
You learn corruption is spreading faster than expected. Time is limited.

ACT 2 — The Shattered Expanse
Goal: Collect all 3 Prime Relics
Gameplay Loop:
This is where the game opens up:

Each region has a theme (Forest Ruins, Sand Ruins, Crystal Ruins).

Shops start selling useful relic upgrades.

Enemies get quirks (poison, armor, dodge).

Mid‑bosses in each region drop the remaining Prime Relics.

Story Beat:
An NPC warns you:

“The Warden wasn’t always a monster… it once protected us.”

Hints of lore and the tragedy behind the boss.

Optional twist:
The shops slowly get more expensive due to spreading corruption.

ACT 3 — The Heart of Ruin
Goal: Enter the final dungeon + defeat the Warden
Gameplay Loop:
You unlock the final area with the 3 Prime Relics.

Final shop acts as your last preparation point.

Gauntlet of stronger enemies (maybe puzzles too).

Boss Fight: The Ruin Warden

Has phases

Uses relic powers against you

Forces real strategy: items, equipped relics, timing

Story Beat (Ending Options):
You get to choose an ending based on relics collected:

ENDING A — Cleanse the Warden
You free its spirit → world slowly recovers.

ENDING B — Take the Warden’s Core
You gain ultimate power → corruption now follows YOU.
(Sets up a sequel.)

ENDING C — Escape with the relics
You bail, selling relics to the highest bidder.
(Comedic/greedy ending.)

🎯 How this helps your coding
Easy chapter progression = clean functions/modules

Prime relics = perfect boolean locks for areas

Shops = dictionaries + list management

Boss phases = fun conditional logic

Random encounters = great practice with RNG
